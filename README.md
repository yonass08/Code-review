This README file contains the instructions you should follow to successfully complete the Code Review Assessment.

In this github repository, you’ll find 4 python files: snippet_1.py, snippet_2.py, snippet_3.py, and snippet_4.py. 

Your goal is to follow the steps you learned to conduct proper code review and approve pull requests. This practice is to be completed in groups of 5.

Instructions 
  1. Designate one person as the code reviewer. The code reviewer should then create a git repository locally and publish it to github.
  2. Create a git branch and copy the contents of snippet_1.py to a file the following file named content.py in this repository.
  3. Push your changes to the remote branch and create a pull request. 
  4. Review the code as a team. Make necessary modifications to the code. Solve Merge conflicts
  5. When you believe the code to be acceptable, approve the request.
  6. Repeat steps 2-4 for all files. 

Good luck!
